This is a VST3 plugin to convert a stereo signal to mono. The plugin is just a single screen with one button.
When enabled, it converts your stereo signal to mono. The output will still be a stereo channel but the left channel will equal
the right.

This plugin was developed using the JUCE framework: https://juce.com/

This plugin has been tested on Windows 10 and works. Has not been tested on iOS but it should work since JUCE is cross-platform.
